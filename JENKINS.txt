JENKINS
INSTALLATION OF LATEST VERSION OF JAVA ON PUTTY
Step1:	we need a server. So, I am talking EC2 instance.
-	Tag Name = JenkinsServer
-	Allowing all traffic for now… (but recommended tight security)
-	Launch
Step2: Login in to putty using public ID
-	Ec2-user@x.y.z.a
-	Auth-key_link
-	Launch the Comand Line Interface
Step3: Check weather java in installed or not in that opened CLI by typing
-	Sudo -i
-	Java
Note: Two ways in install JENKINS. 1. By Dockers and 2. WAR files. Here we are following WAR files
WAR FILE INSTALLATIONS 
Step 4: Copy link Address http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
-	Download your warfile in terminal: 
wget http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
-	ls 
-	Extract that war file: java -jar Jenkins.war
-	Check the version of java: java -version
-	I am installing java 1.8
-	Download java 1.8  jdk-8u151-linux-x64.tar.gz
Step5: Download WinSCP
-	Open WinSCP (Secure CoPy)
-	Hostname: IP
-	Username: ec2-user
-	Click on Advance -> ssh -> Authentication -> browse your .ppk key
-	Once connected 
Select the download JAVA file. Drag and drop in another window
Step7: Once the transfer in done. In your terminal
-	Copy the jdk.gz file from ec2-user to root by sudo cp /pwd/jdk.gz /root
-	You can see file is copied in root 
-	Go to root by sudo -i
-	ls-> u can see your 1.8 version 
-	Extract .gz file by tar -xvzf jdk-xxxxxxxx.tar.gz
-	Ls -> u can see .gz is been extracted
Step8: Once you extract, in the terminal
-	Which java
-	cd /usr/bin
-	ls -al | grep java
-	You can see java is in java -> /etc/alternatives/ java
-	cd /etc/alternatives
-	ls -al | grep java
-	you can see java -> pointed to java 1.7 version, but we want to java to point java 1.8 version
-	cd /root/jdk1.8xxxxxxx/bin
-	ls : here we can see java
?	So, Copy the path cd /root/jdk1.8.1xxx/bin/java
-	Change the softlin.
?	Go back to cd /usr/bin
?	Ls -al | grep java
?	Cd /etc/alternatives (or simple cd -)
?	ln -s /root/jdk1.8xxxx/bin/java java (Here /root/jdk1.8xxxx/bin/java symbolic link)
-	ls -al | grep java
?	You can see now it is pointing to java1.8.1
-	Check java -version
Step9: Change the java home directory Something like environmental variable
-	Echo $JAVA_HOME -> you get /user/lib/jvm/jre (old version java1.7.xxx path)
-	But wee should get latest java1.8.xx
-	Cd /root/jdk1.8.x/
-	Pwd -> /root/jdk1.8.xx 
-	Copy the path. That path should be our environmental path / Java home you can say
-	Export JAVA_HOME=/root/jdk1.8.xx 
-	Echo $JAVA_HOME ->  we get latest path, but it works only once, its not permanent. We need to make global, for all terminals
-	So copy the path and open file in etc/bashrc vim /etc/bashrc
?	Add that path at the end of the file
?	:wq!
•	If I don’t want to set for all user and I wany to make it only for me then add that path to basrc file which is present in-home directory
•	Cd /root
•	Ls -al -> I can see .bashrc
•	Vim .bashrc
•	Add end of the line
Similarly to ec2user
Cd /home/ec2-user/
Ls -al
Vim .bashrc file
-	Run source bashrc to trigger the changes
Step10: INSTALL JENKINS
-	Run java -jar Jenkins.war
-	In new window -> copy and paste IPaddress:8080 -> enter
-	You will see Jenkins screen asking for password
-	Copy and paste password 
-	Install recommended plugins
-	Create new user and password etc
-	Start using Jenkins
Step11: logout and login to check weather working properly 
-	If you stop backside running terminal by ctrl+c automatically here Jenkins stops working
-	Restart again by Java -jar Jenkins.war & -> enter -> its starts running properly
-	Now you can close the terminal. & helps in running background

NOTE: I have duplicated the session and closed the present running session or terminal
Logged in as a root and checked weather Jenkins is running or not by the command
-	Ps -ef | grep Jenkins 
-	root     24322     1 20 10:08 ?        00:00:25 java -jar jenkins.war
root     24430 24412  0 10:10 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto Jenkins

-	cd /root
-	ls -al
?	.jenkins
-	Cd .jenkins
-	Ls
You will see jobs, nodes, users,plugins,secrets,logs etc
Note: We can see that Jenkins will store all of its files in /root/.jenkins. If you use yum install Jenkins.war, then it will store in /var/lib/Jenkins
